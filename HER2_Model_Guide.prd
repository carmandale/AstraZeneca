# HER2-Trastuzumab 3D Model Creation Guide

## Objective
Create a scientifically accurate and visually engaging 3D model of the HER2 protein complexed with trastuzumab (Herceptin) antibody, optimized for use in visionOS 2 projects and AR/VR environments.

## Source Data
- Protein Data Bank (PDB) file: [PDB ID 1N8Z](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1N8Z)
  - High-resolution atomic coordinates of HER2 and trastuzumab.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Obtain Structure Data
- Download the HER2-Trastuzumab complex structure from the [RCSB PDB website](https://www.rcsb.org/).

### Step 2: Visualization and Conversion
- Use PyMOL or UCSF Chimera:
  - Load the downloaded PDB file.
  - Generate a surface or ribbon representation to clearly visualize interaction.
  - Export as OBJ or Collada (DAE) format for compatibility with Blender.

### Step 3: Blender Import
- Import the converted OBJ or DAE file into Blender.
- Verify mesh integrity and model scale.

### Step 4: Optimization for AR/VR
- Ensure the model's polygon count remains manageable for real-time AR rendering (ideally below 100,000 polygons).
- Optimize the mesh:
  - Simplify geometry where needed.
  - Use decimation modifiers judiciously.

### Step 5: Texturing and Shading
- Apply visually appealing and scientifically illustrative textures:
  - HER2 protein: Suggested color blue.
  - Trastuzumab antibody: Suggested color pink or red.
- Adjust materials for clear visual differentiation and readability.

### Step 6: Export for visionOS
- Export optimized and textured model to USDZ format, ensuring compatibility with Apple Vision Pro and visionOS 2.

## Final Deliverables
- Optimized USDZ model file for visionOS.
- Original Blender source file (.blend).
- Documentation noting the PDB source, conversion settings, and any optimization steps taken.

## Usage
- Integrate the completed model into the visionOS 2 SwiftUI-based viewer project for interactive 3D visualization.
